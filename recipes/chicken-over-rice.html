        <h2>Description</h2>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Chicken thighs</li>
            <li>Spices</li>
            <li>Garlic</li>
            <li>Greek yogurt and mayo</li>
            <li>Basmati rice</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Garnishes</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>For the Halal Chicken Marinade: Set out a large baking dish. In the dish, combine the fresh lemon juice, olive oil, minced garlic, oregano, coriander, cumin, 1 ½ teaspoons of salt, and ½ teaspoon of cracked black pepper. Whisk well. Then place the chicken thighs into the marinade. Turn them over to coat the chicken on all sides. Cover the dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 to 2 hours. (This step can be done a day in advance if needed.)</li>
            <li>For the Yogurt Sauce: Set out a medium bowl or measuring pitcher. Combine the Greek yogurt, mayonnaise, lemon juice, sugar, and garlic powder. Mix until smooth. Then taste, and add salt and pepper as needed. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use.</li>
            <li>For the Yellow Rice: Set a medium saucepot on the stovetop over medium heat. Add the butter. Once melted, stir in the rice making sure it is coated well with butter. Stir in the chicken base, turmeric, onion powder, and ground cumin. Stir well to coat the rice, then stir in 4 cups of water. Cover the pot and bring to a boil. Cook according to the time listed on the rice package, usually 15 to 20 minutes. The rice is done when vent holes have formed in the top of the rice, and the top looks dry and fluffy. Remove from heat, fluff the rice, and cover again to keep warm.</li>
            <li>Preheat a grill (or grill pan) to medium heat, about 350°F. Once hot, grill the marinated chicken for 5 minutes per side. Allow the chicken to rest for an additional 5 minutes so the juices settle. Then slice the chicken thighs into thin strips.</li>
            <li>To Plate: Place a large scoop of fluffy yellow rice in a bowl or on a plate. Top with sliced grilled chicken. Add several pita strips to the plate column followed by a hearty scoop of shredded lettuce and diced tomatoes. Dollop or drizzle yogurt sauce over the top, followed by harissa hot sauce if desired. Sprinkle chopped parsley over the chicken and rice and serve warm.</li>
