        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This family-favorite angel chicken recipe is full of flavor and easy to make with condensed soup and cream cheese. It's special enough to serve when you're entertaining guests. I usually double the recipe so we can have leftovers.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>6 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
            <li>¼ cup butter</li>
            <li>1 (.7 ounce) package dry Italian-style salad dressing mix</li>
            <li>1 (10.5 ounce) can condensed golden mushroom soup</li>
            <li>½ cup white wine</li>
            <li>4 ounces cream cheese with chives</li>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package angel hair pasta</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Arrange chicken breasts in a single layer in a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
            <li>Melt butter in a large saucepan over low heat. Stir in dressing mix, then stir in condensed soup and wine. Add cream cheese; cook and stir, without boiling, until smooth and heated through. Pour over chicken.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
            <li>About 15 minutes before the chicken is finished, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a rolling boil. Add angel hair pasta and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain.</li>
            <li>Serve the chicken and sauce over the pasta.</li>
        </ol>
