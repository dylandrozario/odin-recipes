        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This creamy high protein broccoli Cheddar soup is packed full of veggies and gets its creaminess—and extra protein—from beans and cottage cheese. The soup is partially blended for a nice, thick base.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons Butter</li>
            <li>1 yellow onion, chopped</li>
            <li>1 large carrot, chopped</li>
            <li>1 stalk celery, chopped</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 (15.5 ounce) can navy beans, drained</li>
            <li>4 cups chicken broth</li>
            <li>1 ½ pounds broccoli, chopped</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt or to taste</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 cup full-fate cottage cheese (small or large curd)</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt butter in a large stockpot over medium heat. Add onion, carrot, and celery. Cook for 8 minutes. Add garlic and cook 2 minutes more. Add beans, broth, broccoli, paprika, salt, and pepper. Simmer for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Turn heat off; ladle about 1 ½ cups of soup into a blender. Let cool for 10 minutes. This cooling step is important for blending cottage cheese.</li>
            <li>Add cottage cheese to blender; blend until smooth. Return mixture to the stockpot; turn heat back on to low. Add Cheddar cheese and stir until melted and soup is thickened. Ladle into bowls and serve.</li>
        </ol>
